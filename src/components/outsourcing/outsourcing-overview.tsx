            Adding the right technical talent to your team is hard. Especially
            when you need to scale fast without a lengthy hiring process.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-8">
            We have realised that hiring and resource management is one of the
            biggest challenges faced by enterprises. With the help of
            Nextstacks, our E-Learning initiative, we have successfully trained
            a large number of developers and outsourced them to our clients to
            be part of their growth journey.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-8">
            The performance of our developers has created a long lasting impact
            on our clients and this has played a large role in the growth of our
            company. We see a potential to become a major player in the market
            in the outsourcing industry and everyday we strive to make the
            learning process more efficient for our students and employees.
